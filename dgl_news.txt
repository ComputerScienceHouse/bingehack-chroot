2013.01.18
 - Added an "Adventurer's Notebook" to keep track of games.

2011.10.08

2011.09.15

2011.01.21
 - Switch from "virus" to "ee" for the nethackrc editor.

2010.09.08
 - Dipping a potion of acid into a fountain should no longer cause game crashes.

2010.09.04
 - Add a new ncurses interface to Nethack (yes, a second one).
   - It will be enabled in the new player nethackrc once all the bugs are
     ironed out.
 - NOTE: With either of the ncurses interfaces, IBMgraphics requires a Unicode
   enabled terminal in order for it to work properly.
 - Fix an aggregious bug where most of the #enhance menu would be missing.
 - In the old interface, the bottom line should no longer randomly lose
   coloring.
 - If restoring a game while wearing the ring of power, you should no longer get
   the message "Gee! Suddenly, you can see right through yourself!"

2010.05.26
 - Fixed the help menu.
 - IBMgraphics and DECgraphics should now always appear properly.

2010.05.15
 - Nethack has changed servers. It is now hosted off of "games.csh.rit.edu". The
   hostname "nethack.csh.rit.edu" should continue to work for playing nethack.
 - If your telnet supports providing login credentials, you can login to nethack
   automatically. Ex: telnet -l username:pass nethack.csh.rit.edu
 - Save games and bones files were lost _again_ due to the _same_ error on my
   part. I've subsequently removed the command that enabled me to make this
   mistake _twice_. Sorry. -Russ

2010.05.13
 - Weight can now be colored using statuscolors. Use the keyword "wt"
 - A new option "showborn" is available. When enabled and the game ends, it will
   show the number of each monster created in the "Vanquished Creatures" list.
 - A new option "showrealtime" is available. When enabled, it shows the "real
   world" time on the status bar.
 - A new ncurses based high score and log viewer is available. There's still
   some bugs.
 - Dying with death_explore set now has dialogs which fit better with the
   context.

2010.05.11
 - All save games and high scores for the past day were lost due to an error on
   my part. Sorry. -Russ

2010.05.10
 - High scores, and play logs now viewable.
 - Information pages now paginated with less.
 - Pets will follow pets that follow you when you climb stairs.
 - Dipping a loadstone into potion of enlightenment turns it into a flint
   stone.
 - Add the ability to use alt as the Meta-key, for extended commands.
 - Dissolve valuable gems in acid to make potions.
 - Beartraps wound your feet as per xans.
 - Casting a spell while wielding a gem will destroy the gem and remove some
   restrictions from the spellcasting.
   - You can try to cast spells that you have forgotten. If you do cast such a
     spell, the gem power and the gem will be used up for that. At minimum gem
     power there's a 1/3 chance the gem will not help, and the higher the gem
     power, the smaller the chance it won't help.
   - Gem powered spells will ignore the restrictions for hunger, strength,
     carrying capacity and free hand. (But if you're wielding a gem, the last
     one doesn't matter anyway)
   - Gem power will lower the energy used up in the spell casting, by half at
     maximum.
 - The extra status shown on the bottom line are also shown in the C-x window.
 - Cancellation will disarm a magical trap.
 - A bunch of additional conducts, including "RL time wasted".
 - Key bindings which you can change in the config file.
 - User can change the colors of the dungeon features and traps, by setting
   options in the config file.
 - User can define if menus and text-windows are left or right aligned.
 - Changes the option 'fixinv' to compound option, allowing finer degree of
   control.
