### The Adventurer's Notebook ###
You can use this file as a place to store notes about your game(s).

Notes such as:
- "There's an aligned altar on level 4, and my stash is on level 6"*
- "I'm poison resistant"
- "When I saved the game, it was Safe To Pray"

are all examples of things that might be very useful for you to know,
especially if you come back to a saved game a few days later.

*this particular functionality is superseded by the 'annotate' function
  in our upcoming version of "BingeHack 4" (just fyi)
